Abhinaav Singh: Hello everybody, my name is open up and i'm an information systems graduate student at CMU i'm going to spend the next few minutes talking about Amazon prime watch party and how it changed the product service system for Amazon prime video.

2
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.530
Abhinaav Singh: Let me start by talking about how the online movie streaming industry is rapidly evolving.

3
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:45.600
Abhinaav Singh: Online movies streaming was already growing at a fast pace, but covert acted as a catalyst, helping it grow exponentially, according to a survey by statistics by June credit 20 36% adults preferred streaming movies online as compared to only 14% that prefer to watch it in a theater.

4
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:57.180
Abhinaav Singh: Not only that Amazon prime video is particularly doing well in the industry already at number two it is quickly closing the gap between itself and netflix the industry leader.

5
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:07.680
Abhinaav Singh: By q2 of 2021 time we do boasted of having captured 20% of the market share extremely close to netflix's 28% market share.

6
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.860
Abhinaav Singh: Previously, there were only two major ways of watching a movie that friends, the first one was to meet friends and then go to a theater to watch a movie.

7
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.460
Abhinaav Singh: The second way was to meet friends at home and then watch a movie on a streaming service like prime video together.

8
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:40.410
Abhinaav Singh: trying to do was already overtake theaters and most of the direct competitors and becoming the go to group movie viewing experience one way in which it was doing so was to curating a vast enrich movie catalog.

9
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.470
Abhinaav Singh: This behind the visibility line action seem to be enough before the advent of covert.

10
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.940
Abhinaav Singh: However, covert change industry heavily and the activities highlighted in red became extremely difficult to perform anymore.

11
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.550
Abhinaav Singh: One could no longer meet with friends to watch a movie in theaters or stream it together.

12
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.860
Abhinaav Singh: This made it quite difficult to have the same social experience of movie viewing as we, as we were used to before covert.

13
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.790
Abhinaav Singh: It became obvious that Amazon would have have to see how they could innovate at the touch points of their service to provide a similar if not a better experience.

14
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.810
Abhinaav Singh: time we did recognize this challenge as an opportunity and introduced a service called watch party.

15
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:45.390
Abhinaav Singh: This service enabled users to view movies together about virtually, this was an extremely clever way to replicate the same social experience in a way that the users could still enjoy the company of their friends, while watching their favorite flick.

16
00:02:46.890 --> 00:03:00.870
Abhinaav Singh: The journey here shows the user first going to Amazon prime then starting a watch party for the favorite movie This allows them to view the same movie together in a synchronous fashion and to interact with each other, while the movies playing.

17
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:12.570
Abhinaav Singh: there's also help Amazon accelerate co creation of value with customers, as the viewers could derive entertainment, not just from the stream movie but also from the interactions with difference.

18
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.960
Abhinaav Singh: Now let's look at the elemental dominance and how it award.

19
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.210
Abhinaav Singh: Before watch party time we do still had a lot service component in the form of the movie viewing experience during online streaming.

20
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.630
Abhinaav Singh: It did have a relatively small physical component, but it's prime fire stick and the remote.

21
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.260
Abhinaav Singh: Interestingly, the fire stick and remote also acted as peripheral evidence for the movie streaming service.

22
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.870
Abhinaav Singh: other items like the laptop or the TV itself added to the physical component.

23
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:57.270
Abhinaav Singh: Now, after the launch of watch party, the elemental dominance further shifted towards the server side with the added experience of virtually viewing movies, along with friends.

24
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.840
Abhinaav Singh: Looking at the same scenario two planes lenses you are able to identify which service value is dominant.

25
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.780
Abhinaav Singh: You can tell that watch party as a service was more about providing access to users.

26
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
Abhinaav Singh: As it was giving them a movie viewing experience with their loved ones.

27
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.010
Abhinaav Singh: let's look at the same experience in the context of how unbundling unbundling of the experience to place to the introduction of watch party.

28
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:40.080
Abhinaav Singh: Previously, the user, how to log into prime video start the movie and independently view the movie whole movie only after that could they discuss the movie with your friends.

29
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.230
Abhinaav Singh: This was a departure from the social experience of watching the movie with loved ones and sharing that moment together to interactions as the movie was being played.

30
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.900
Abhinaav Singh: let's try to look at the service addition in terms of team materialisation and unbundling experience.

31
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.330
Abhinaav Singh: The experiences D materialized a lot, as there is no longer than need to physically meet with friends to enjoy their company, while viewing movies.

32
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:19.230
Abhinaav Singh: Amazon has unbundled the experience and paralyze the experience of sharing parts and discussing experiences as they are viewing the movie online instead of discussing it after having beautiful movie.

33
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.920
Abhinaav Singh: That was all from my side hope you enjoyed the presentation, thank you.
